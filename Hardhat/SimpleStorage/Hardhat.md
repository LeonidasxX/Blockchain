# HARDHAT

## HARDHAT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

1. Flexible javascript absed development environment to compile, deploy, test and debug EVM based smart contracts
2. Enable easy intergration of code and external tools
3. Local Hardhat Network to simulate Ethereum
4. Extensible plugin features
5. High level of debussing features

Hardhat website has a tutorial page from where we can learn and take codes easily!

## SETTING UP HARDHAT

1. Creating new project folder / specifying our project

```console
yarn init
```

This creates a `package.json` file for us and adds all the necessary details.

2. Adding hardhat to our project:

```console
yarn add --dev hardhat
```

3. Starting our hardhatr project:

```console
yarn hardhat
```

This asks us if we want a js projectm typescript project or an empty hardhat.config.js
We can select any one of the option and create our project.
After this, we have succesfully created our hardhat boilerplate project.
Node modules which starts with `@` sign are known as scoped packages which allow npm packages to be namespaced. Every user and organisation on npm has their own scope, and they are the only people who can add packages to it.
This allows organisations to make it clear which packages are official and which ones are not.

Now if we run yarn hardhat we are gonna get a list of all the commands we can do using hardhat

## Hardhat setup troubshooting

If we do yarn hardhat for initialize our project and instead of asking what type of project we want to make, it just shows us the hardhat commands, then it means that we have a `hardhat.config.js` file or a node module in some higher level folder. If this happend cd down using `cd ..` and ls to check if we got a hardhat config file or node module init.
Deleting the hardhat config file will solve our problem.
To find this file we can use:

```console
yarn hardhat --verbose
```

This tells us where exactly our hardhat file is located and we can delete it. Another way can be by using npm install

## Hardhat tasks

Commands that runs with hardhat.

yarn hardhat accounts to get the fake accounts, similar to what we got from ganache.

## Developing Simple Storage with Hardhat

### Compiling

To compile we just run:

```console
yarn hardhat compile
```

If we get a version error we need to change the hardhat config file version to match the contract version or vice versa

After compiling our contract, we can see that a folder will be added in artifacts folder containing json files

### Deploying - Writing deploy script

Basic deploy script structure: imports -> async main -> main

Here, we import ethers from hardhat

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
```

We run our script using:

```console
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Basic code-snippet for starting hardhat and deploying our contract with it:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const SimpleStorageFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(
        "SimpleStorage"
    );
    console.log("Deploying contract...");
    const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorageFactory.deploy();
    await simpleStorage.deployed();
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

## HARDHAT Network

Here, we did not provide the private key and the rpc url link. But our contract will stil be deployed. This is where Hardhat Network tool comes in.
This is a built in tool, a local ethereum network node designed for development. It allows us to deploy our contracts, run our tests and debug our codes.
Whenver we run our deploy file wothout providing the key and rpc link, hardhat network tool automatically assigns it a network and a private key. It's similar to ganche and work in backend
In hardhat config file, it sets the defaultNetwork to hardhat. We can change the network accoring to our preference and also provide our own wallet's private keys.
While switching netween multiple networks, we can specify in console which network we want to use:

```console
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```

To add an external rpc url,
we first create a .env file -> now we can add the RPC url from alchemy goerli faucet here -> now we can add the url to the goerli network in config file
Now to add the private key, we add a field called account after url. We can give a list of all acounts we want to include in our project.
We can also give the chainId of the network.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
const GOERLI_RPC_URL = process.env.GOERLI_RPC_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        goerli: {
            url: GOERLI_RPC_URL,
            accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
            chainId: 5,
        },
    },
};
```

### Programatic Verification

We can add code to directly verify after we deploy our contract.

First we install, etherscan -> it's a hardhat plugin

```console
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
```

Now, etherscan requires an api key to verify. We can get the api key from etherscan website. We store this api key inside our .env file.
Now we can add this api key into our hardhat config file.

```javascript
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan");
const ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY;
module.exports = {
    ehtherscan: {
        apiKey: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
    },
};
```

By adding this, we get a new console task called verify:

```console
yarn verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
```

But a better way to this would be to do it in our program using verification funciton. In our code we can run any task provided in console by hardhat. For this we will import run which allows us to run any hardhat task.

```javascript
const { ethers, run } = require("hardhat");
```

Our final verification function :

```javascript
async function verify(contractAddress, args) {
    console.log("Verifying contract...");
    try {
        await run("verify:verify", {
            address: contractAddress,
            constructorArguments: args,
        });
    } catch (e) {
        if (e.message.toLowerCase().includes("already verified")) {
            console.log("Already Verified!");
        } else {
            console.log(e);
        }
    }
}
```

We added try catch block because if our contract is already verified, it will throw an error, hence we fix it using try-catch.

We don't want to verify our local network(hardhat), hence we check if the network we our using is a live/test network by :

This is where chainId come to use as using chainid, we can verify if it's a local or live network.

```javascript
const { ethers, run, network } = require("hardhat");
// inside async main function
if (network.config.chainId === 5 && process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_ID) {
    await simpleStorage.deployTransaction.wait(6); // we want few blocks (here 6) to be mined before verifying our contract
    await verify(simpleStorage.address, []);
}
```

## Interacting with Contracts in Hardhat

```javascript
// inside async main function
const currentFavoriteNumber = await simpleStorage.retrieve();
console.log(`Current Value: ${currentValue}`);
// updating value
const transactionResponse = await simpleStorage.store(7);
await transactionResponse.wait(1);
const updatedValue = await simpleStorage.retrieve();
console.log(`Updated Value: ${UpdatedVale}`);
```

## Artifacts Troubleshooting

If our code is not compiled correctly and states that no suck file or directory found. Delete the artifacts and cache folder.

```console
yarn hardhat clean
```

Whenever we run our deploy command:

```console
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Hardhat automatically compiles the contract for us and we get a new artifacts and cache file

## Custom Hardhat Tasks

Create a folder tasks, create a new task file .js file

```javascript
const { task } = require("hardhat/config");

// task("name", "description")
task("block-number", "Prints the current block number").setAction(
    // hre - hardhat runtime env
    async (taskArgs, hre) => {
        const blockNumber = await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
        console.log(`Current block number: ${blockNumber}`);
    }
);

module.exports = {};
```

Adding this to our config file:

```javascript
require(".tasks/block-number");
```

Tasks are better for plugins and scripts are better for our own local development environment

## Hardhat Local Host Node

Similar Ganache network, this network is not running on our default hardhat network

```console
yarn hardhat node
```

We need to add this network to our config file:

```json
localhost: {
            url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545/",
            chainId: 31337, // same chainid as hardhat
            // we don't need to give accounts as it already gives us 20 fake accounts
        },
```

To stop the network, just use ctrl + c

## Hardhat Console

What if i dont want to write an entire code to do something (deploy)?
hardhat comes with a console. the console is a js environment for us to run js commands as to interact with any blockchain. Jump on console:

yarn hardhat console --network localhost

Now we will be dropped to a shell where we can do everything we do in the deploy script because everything in hardhat is automatically imported into our console
We can run the deploy file code directly on our console.
It is a simple way to interact faster with our contract

## Runing TESTS

hardhat test works with the mocha js framework. testing with the modern programming language(not solidity) gives us more flexibility

To run test:

```console
yarn hardhat test
```

To run only one test:

```console
yarn hardhat test --grep (any keyword of the test) store
```

or add a .only. it.only()

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");

// describe("name-string", anonymous function/ function)
describe("SimpleStorage", function () {
    let SimpleStorageFactory, simpleStorage;
    beforeEach(async function () {
        // deploying our simple storage contract
        SimpleStorageFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage");
        simpleStorage = await SimpleStorageFactory.deploy();
    });
    it(// what we what this specific test to do and then give the code to actually do that
    "Should start with a favorite number of 0", async function () {
        const curretnValue = await simpleStorage.retrieve();
        const expectedValue = "0";
        // check using assert or expect, both imported from chai
        assert.equal(curretnValue.toString(), expectedValue);
        // expect(currentValue.toString()).to.equal(expectedValue)
    });
    it("should update when we call store", async function () {
        const expectedValue = "7";
        const transactionResponse = await simpleStorage.store(expectedValue);
        await transactionResponse.wait(1);
        const currentValue = await simpleStorage.retrieve();
        assert.equal(currentValue.toString(), expectedValue);
    });
});
```

## Hardhat Gas Reporter

Calculating how much gas does it actually costs, extension - hardhat-gas-reporter
It gets attacehed to each of our tests and tells us how much each test/function costs

yarn add hardhat-gas-reporter --dev

Now we can go to config and add some parameters to add some config info to work with it

```javascript
require("hardhat-gas-reporter");
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        gasReporter: {
            enabled: true,
        },
    },
};
```

Now when we run our test, it automatically runs gas reporter
We can get the output on a output file, make sure to add this output file in git ignore
outputfile: "gas-report.txt"

```javascript
gasReporter: {
        enabled: true,
        outputFile: "gas-reports.txt",
        noColors: true,
        currency: "USD",
    },
```

In order to get the value in currency we need to get the api from coin market cap, get the api key and paste it in .env file. Then add the following code:

```javascript
const COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY = process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY
// inside gasReposter
coinmarketcap: COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY,
```

## Solidity Coverage

Tools/plugin to prevent our contract from getting hacked.
It goes through all the lines of our code and check how many lines are covered
Adding solidity coverage:

```
yarn add --dev solidity-coverage
```

And then adding to .config file:

```javascript
require("solidity-coverage");
```

Then:

```
yarn hardhat coverage
```

Put coverage.json file and coverage in .gitignore
In uncovered lines, it shows the line of code which we didn't included in our tests
